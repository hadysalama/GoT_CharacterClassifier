# GoT_CharacterClassifier
A Django Python Web Application that implements an exported computer vision model trained using a Resnet50 Deep Convolutional Neural Network for image classification. The exported model can classify Game of Thrones Characters Danaerys Targaryen, Sansa Stark, and Tyrion Lanister from images of Danaerys Targaryen, Sansa Stark, and Tyrion Lanister or their respective actresses and actor, Emilia Clarke, Sophie Turner and Peter Dinklage. The exported model has a 3.2% error rate. For best results use single person images of each character or actor like portraits. Do not use images that have 2 or more of the 3 listed characters or actors in them.
